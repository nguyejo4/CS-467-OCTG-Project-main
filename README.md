# CS-467-OCTG-Project
Repository for CS 467 OCTG Project

Our team aims to create a trading card game for an classroom education experience akin to
Hearthstone and Magic The Gathering. Our goal is to have a game that captures the
excitement and fun of a typical TCG game with elements to aid in the learning process for a
specific discipline while having fun. We will be doing this by utilizing the Unity game engine
and scripting in C#.

At project completion, students will be able to play with each other in a classroom tournament, allowing
them to earn points and coins, which they can spend acquiring more cards. The aim is to gamify
the classroom, hopefully engaging students more strongly in their education.

Game Requirements:
- Must be web-based
- Tournaments will have a title page, and the name of the current opponent.
- Students can use cards they have bought/earned to play an online TCG.
- Students can earn points from wins. Coins can be earned as well.
- Games end based on time or when one player wins.

Software & Languages:
- Unity WebGL
- C# for coding
- Unity takes our C# and will compile it to run on a web plugin
- Python/MySQL for Database back-end

Assets:
- DOTween (UnityAssetStore) to animate actions
- Card Design pack (UnityAssetStore)

Estimated Minimum Requirements to Run Finished Game1:
- Updated Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge

Sources
- Using unity, we will use public domain images, fan-made art, and the unity art
package for trading card games and will be referencing each source.
